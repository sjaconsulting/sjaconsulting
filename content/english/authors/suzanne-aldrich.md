Raised in Northern California's scenic landscapes, Suzanne's early passion for technology led her to Stanford University, where she studied Computer Science with a focus on human-tech interaction. Notably, she designed a pioneering website hosted on the world's smallest webserver. Suzanne has since excelled in Sales Engineering leadership at top tech companies including Cloudflare, Vercel, and Chronosphere. At SJA Consulting, she applies her expertise to empower small and midsize businesses with robust web development and cybersecurity solutions. Beyond tech, Suzanne enjoys nature hikes with her family, fostering a new generation of engineering talent in her daughters.
